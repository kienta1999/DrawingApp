## Enhance user's ability
1. Opacity slide
User can slide to choose the opacity of the line before drawing (the line slider is put beside the thick slider that adjust the line's thickness).

2. Redo
User may accidentally undos the line that they should not. Redo button will help user cancel the undo command and get the undoed lines back.

## Screenshot the picture

The button Save will help saving the picture (the canvas where user draws only, not the whole screen) to the library
